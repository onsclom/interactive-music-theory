# Equal Temperament

An introduction to music theory.

# Twelve notes

Pianos are a nice way to visualize music theory, so we will use them a lot. Checkout this one!

Notice that pianos have a repeating pattern of 7 white keys and 5 black keys.

[PIANO COMPONENT w/ HERTZ]

These pitches are separated by a fixed interval.

This is a bit unintuitive on a piano. It would be more intuitive if black keys were the same size as the white keys.

# Intervals

Notes aren't very special in isolation. They become interesting when played in relation to each other. We call these relations **intervals**.

One can play any song starting from any note. The song will still be recognizeable!

The pattern becomes more clear on the "intuitive piano"!

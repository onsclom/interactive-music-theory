# Equal Temperament

_An introduction to music theory for beginners with little to no music experience_

Pianos are a nice way to visualize music theory, so we will use them a lot. Checkout this one!

Notice how pianos have a repeating pattern of 7 white keys and 5 black keys.

Let's focus on the white notes first. Each note has a letter name.

[ONLY WHITE KEY PIANO WITH LETTER NAMES]

You might find it confusing how note names repeat. These notes are called **octaves**. While they are lower or higher pitched, they serve the same function in ✨ harmony ✨. You can think of pitch existing on a spiral.

You might noticed that there are 5 gaps per octave. These are the black keys on the piano! They are called **sharps** (#) and **flats** (b). They are named after the white notes they are closest to.

still in progress... to cover:

- there are other note systems which sound different and/or have a different number of notes
- equal temperament arbitrarily chooses 440hz for A4
- explain transposing (relative intervals is what makes music)
